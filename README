🛡️ Network Guardian SIEM

Network Guardian is a custom-built Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool. It provides real-time visibility into network traffic, performs deep packet inspection (DPI) for sensitive keywords, and visualizes data through an interactive web dashboard.

✨ Features
Live Traffic Analysis: Real-time monitoring of TCP/UDP packets using Scapy.
Geographical Tracking: Integration with IPinfo to identify the physical location and Organization (ISP) of source IPs.
Deep Packet Inspection: Scans raw payloads for unencrypted sensitive keywords (e.g., "password", "admin").
Desktop Alerts: Cross-platform system notifications for high-risk traffic.
Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit to show traffic "heartbeats," service distribution, and alert logs.
Audit Reporting: One-click CSV export for security forensics and compliance.

🏗️ Architecture
The tool uses a multi-threaded approach to ensure no packets are dropped during UI rendering:
The Engine (Scapy): Sniffs raw traffic and extracts metadata.
The Logic (Python/Pandas): Filters duplicates and matches keywords.
The UI (Streamlit): Consumes the processed data for live visualization.

🚀 Installation
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. You will also need libpcap installed on your system (standard on Linux/Mac; use Npcap for Windows).
2. Install Dependencies

pip install streamlit scapy plyer ipinfo pandas

💻 Usage
Obtain an API Token: Sign up for a free token at ipinfo.io.
Configure the Script: Replace your_ipinfo_token_here in the script with your actual token.
Run as Administrator: Since network sniffing requires raw socket access, you must run the tool with elevated privileges.
<!-- end list -->

# Linux / macOS
sudo streamlit run guardian.py

# Windows
# Run your terminal as Administrator, then:
streamlit run guardian.py

🔒 Security & Compliance
Privacy: This tool does not store packet data permanently unless the "Export" button is clicked. All data is stored in a rolling RAM buffer.
Resource Impact: Utilizes Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF) to minimize CPU overhead.
Encryption: The tool respects TLS/SSL boundaries and does not attempt to decrypt secure payloads, ensuring privacy for encrypted communications.
